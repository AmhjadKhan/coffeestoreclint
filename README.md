## Project Description

CoffeeStore is a full-fledged web application designed to manage a coffee store's inventory and sales. The application provides a comprehensive solution for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to coffee products. Users can browse through different coffee categories, view detailed product information, add products to their cart, and make purchases. Additionally, users can leave reviews and ratings for the products they buy.

The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js, ensuring a robust and scalable server-side architecture. MongoDB is used as the database to store product information, user details, and order histories. The frontend is developed with React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. Tailwind CSS is employed to style the application, ensuring a clean and modern look.

Key Features:
- **Add product:** Admins can add, update, and delete coffee products.
- **User Authenticatio:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **user view Cart:** Users can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.
- **user update cart:** Track orders and manage order statuses.
- **User Delete cart:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for products.
